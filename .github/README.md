# PyPlanes - A goofy python project

**Please visit our [Website](https://alphahal0.github.io/) for a cleaner, and more responsive UI on how to work our code.**

This is very work in progress, and any features are liable to change. There may be long periods without updates, and then game changing features released in a matter of hours.

Feel free to fork this repository. Any contributions, be it code cleanups, new art, to full gamechanging logic and features are welcome.

Feel free to discuss and chat at our [Discussion Page](https://github.com/AlphaHal0/PyPlanes/discussions), or create an issue with our [Issues Page](https://github.com/AlphaHal0/PyPlanes/issues)
